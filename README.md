## Overview and Origin

* Name of company : Avant

* Who are the founders of the company?<br/>Paul Zhang, John Sun, and Al Goldstein

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?<br/>According to the company's mission statement, the idea or goal of the company is to "lower the costs and barriers of borrowing for everyday people."

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?<br/>The company is funded through equity and debt financing. It has raised $1.8B through tens rounds of funding.


## Business Activities:

* Through the use of technology, Avant has streamlined the process of obtaining secure and convinient personal loans. Its online platform helps users borrow money at the lowest possible rates. Indiviuals can use the funds for debt consolidations or cover unexpected expenses.  

* The company's intended customers are induviuals with unperfect or below *prime* credit scores or those who are starting to build their credit. Such individulas would not have access to financial products through traditional and stablished lendind entities like banks. Avant uses advanced analytics methods to help cosumers qualify for personal loans ranging from $2,000 to $35,000 at the lowest rate possible. The company lowers the barriers of borrowing by:    
    1. Establishing minimum credit score requirements. 
    2. Offering refinancing pptions.
    3. Flexible payment options.

    Since its establishment, Avant's pool of customers has continued to grow. As of December,2019, its website has recived over 1.1 million monthly visits. According to their official posts, they have already provided more than 800,000 people with personal loans. It's operations are based in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, but its intention is to attract customers from all over the world. The market size for the company's target customers is huge. In the United States alone, currently 14% of the population is considered credit invisible. As of December 18, 2019 that represents over 46 million individuals who will have difficulty getting access to small loans or obtaining a line of credit. This shows the prospect for market growth in the lending industry for years to come. 

    The current market size can also be reprenseted by the millenial population in the United States. By the end of 2019, this group will account for 73 million people of the population. A study showed that in 2018 their average credit score was 658.5, which falls below the *prime* mark. Traditional lenders would consider this people as risky borrowers and will demand a higher premium when providing loans. A higher premium simply means higher borrowing costs for individuals. This is the gap that Avant aims to fill through faster and lower cost loans. 

    

    
* Avant employs advance machine learning algorithms and big data to facilitate personal loans and enhance the customer experience. The entire process is done on its online platform and inviduals can get answers to their loan applications in real time. Since the company targets individuals with subprime credit scores, it must consider multiple factors when determining a person's ability to borrow money. This approach takes into considerion factors that go beyond the traditional measures used by influencial credit score companies. **FICO Scores** are used as the industry standard by lenders. They calculate a person's credit score by anlyzing specific data that fall within these categories: 
  1. Amount owed 
  2. New lines of credit
  3. Length of credit history 
  4. Payment history 
  5. Credit Mix

In contrast, Avant takes advatage of big data to consider more than 10,000 variables to calculate its own credit score about an individual. The amount of data includes, but is not limited to, the applicants use of social media, cell phone, credit, etc. It's machine learning technology is used to determine risk depending on the attributes of each applicant. 


## Landscape:

* Avant aims to be a leading company in the *Digital Lending* industry. It is described as revolutionary online consumer platform that is changing the way consumers can get access personal loans. 

* Bill Gates once stated that "Banking is a neccessity, banks are not." This reflects the common attitude that today's consumers' have when it comes to personal financing. The biggest factor influencing the evolvement of digital lending is that consumers are no longer satisfied with traditional banking. "They are driven by price and convenience". With further advancement in smart phone capabilites, internet speed, computing power, and rapid expansion of FinTech start-ups, incumbents in the online lending industry are striving to provide products and services at a lower cost with consumer experience in mind. Here are key trends that have influenced innovation in the lending landscape: 
  1. **Marketplace acting as matchmakers:** the result of P2P, connects lenders and borrowers from different areas. 
  2. **Birth of new lending products:** people can borrow money at customized rates and periods depending on their specific needs. *Subprime* borrowers have acces to financial products.
  3. **e-KYC has become the norm:** helps businesses identify thier clients electronically in a matter of minutes.  Example: Aadhaar. 


* **Major Players in Digital Personal Lending**
  
  Avant's top competitors are: Prosper, SoFi, bynk, Lendmark, DFC, Enova, OneMain Financial, and Springleaf.
