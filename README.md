* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?<br/>The company is funded through equity and debt financing. It has raised $1.8B through tens rounds of funding.


## Business Activities:

* With the use technology, Avant has streamlined the process of obtaining secure and convenient personal loans. Its online platform helps users borrow money at the lowest possible rates. Individuals can use the funds for debt consolidations or cover unexpected expenses.  

* The company's intended customers are individuals with unperfect or below *prime* credit scores or those who are starting to build their credit. Such individuals would not have access to financial products through traditional and stablished lending entities like banks. Avant uses advanced analytics methods to help consumers qualify for personal loans ranging from $2,000 to $35,000 at the lowest rate possible. The company lowers the barriers of borrowing by:    
    1. Establishing minimum credit score requirements. 
    2. Offering refinancing options.
    3. Flexible payment options.

    Since its establishment, Avant's pool of customers has continued to grow. As of December,2019, its website has received over 1.1 million monthly visits. According to their official posts, they have already provided more than 800,000 people with personal loans. Its operations are based in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, but its intention is to attract customers from all over the world. The market size for the company's target customers is huge. In the United States alone, currently 14% of the population is considered credit invisible. As of December 18, 2019, that represents over 46 million individuals who will have difficulty getting access to small loans or obtaining a line of credit. This shows the prospect for market growth in the lending industry for years to come. 

    The current market size can also be represented by the millennial population in the United States. By the end of 2019, this group will account for 73 million people of the population. A study showed that in 2018 their average credit score was 658.5, which falls below the *prime* mark. Traditional lenders would consider this people as risky borrowers and will demand a higher premium when providing loans. A higher premium simply means higher borrowing costs for individuals. This is the gap that Avant aims to fill through faster and lower cost loans. 

    

    
* Avant employs advance machine learning algorithms and big data to facilitate personal loans and enhance the customer experience. The entire process is done on its online platform and individuals can get answers to their loan applications in real time. Since the company targets individuals with subprime credit scores, it must consider multiple factors when determining a person's ability to borrow money. This approach takes into consideration factors that go beyond the traditional measures used by influential credit score companies. **FICO Scores** are used as the industry standard by lenders. They calculate a person's credit score by analyzing specific data that fall within these categories: 
  1. Amount owed 
  2. New lines of credit
  3. Length of credit history 
  4. Payment history 
  5. Credit Mix

In contrast, Avant takes advantage of big data to consider more than 10,000 variables to calculate its own credit score about an individual. The amount of data includes, but is not limited to, the applicants use of social media, cell phone, credit, etc. It's machine learning technology is used to determine risk depending on the attributes of each applicant. 


## Landscape:

* Avant aims to be a leading company in the *Digital Lending* industry. It is described as revolutionary online consumer platform that is changing the way consumers can get access personal loans. 

* Bill Gates once stated that "Banking is a necessity, banks are not." This reflects the common attitude that today's consumers' have when it comes to personal financing. The biggest factor influencing the evolvement of digital lending is that consumers are no longer satisfied with traditional banking. "They are driven by price and convenience". With further advancement in smart phone capabilities, internet speed, computing power, and rapid expansion of FinTech start-ups, incumbents in the online lending industry are striving to provide products and services at a lower cost with consumer experience in mind. Here are key trends that have influenced innovation in the lending landscape: 
  1. **Marketplace acting as matchmakers:** the result of P2P, connects lenders and borrowers from different areas. 
  2. **Birth of new lending products:** people can borrow money at customized rates and periods depending on their specific needs. *Subprime* borrowers have access to financial products.
  3. **e-KYC has become the norm:** helps businesses identify their clients electronically in a matter of minutes.  Example: Aadhaar. 


* **Major Players in Digital Personal Lending**
  
  Avant's top competitors are: Prosper, SoFi, bynk, Lendmark, DFC, Enova, OneMain Financial, and Springleaf.


## Results

* Avant boasts over 800,000 thousand consumers, and over $5 billon in personal loans from the day it was founded. They maintain their original vision to be the digital bank for nonprime middle-income income consumers in the United States. The company has an estimated 500 current employees and has begun to report profits. Avant wants to continuously roll out new products geared towards their target market. Credit Cards are their latest product and will fuel their growth. The intention behind their credit card is to create a high utility product that will add value to consumers daily. They have been very influential in the lending landscape; well established banks are now realigning their strategy in order to jump into the growth of digital bank. 

As the company expands, the data that is available to them also grows. Since its inception, Avant has completed over a million transactions. All the data that has been recorded to date, enhances Avant's ability to produce loan at the lowest costs possible. In early days of the company the APR for personal loans didn't fall below 36%. Through machine learning and big data, Avant can now offer personal loans with an APR as low as 9.95% to consumers that don't have prime credit scores but are likely to repay their loans within a 24-month period. 

* Some of the core metrics that companies in the lending domain use to measure success are described by the Key Performance Indicator, which measure "productivity, cost, quality, and the volume of...consumer lending products..." being offered by these companies. 
  1. **Conversion Funnel:** uses website traffic to indicate when a prospective borrower is gained or lost.
  2. **Application Pull through Rate/ Loan conversion rate:** would measure the percentage of loans approved based on the number of applications. It helps identify inefficiencies in the lending process. 
  3. **Cross-Sell and Upsell Support:** indicates if the company is offering the right products before losing them to competitors.
  4. **Product Usage:** indicates how often the products or services are being used by consumers. When it comes to loans, companies can determine if they are earning revenue from interests before loans are paid. 
  5. **Time to Decision:** measure the time it takes for a loan to process from the minute the customer enters the website. 
  6. **Automatic Approval Rate:** Measures the number of applications that are approved or denied by the automated online platform divided by the total number of applications submitted over a specific time period. 
  7. **Average Response Time/ Average Resolution time:** Measures the time taken to respond to customer inquiries. 
  8. **Net Promoter Scores:** measures consumer's loyalty. This helps to indicate the amount of people that will be willing to try new products. 
  9. **Costumer Life Time Value:** measures the value of current customers by calculating the present value of future cash flows or the value attituded to customers during their relationship with lending company. 

  Based on KPYs, Avant is showing strong performance. It online platform and business vision is centered around consumer experience. Individuals can get responses to their inquiries in real time and the entire process is done electronically. By using advanced analytics methods, the company can remove loan barriers and reduce borrowing costs. By expanding into the credit card business, the company is also  position itself for long term success as big banks are entering the digital banking business. The credit cards are a product that costumers con use as part of their daily life.
* Avant continues to be the ideal choice for middle income individuals with lower than average credit scores. For example, to qualify for a loan from competitor like Prosper or SoFi, the individual needs to show a strong credit score. Sofi offers loans of up to $100,000 at APRs starting as low as 5.74%, but they require a minimum **FICO** score of 660. LendingClub is a company that offers loans for people with credit scores as low as 600, but unlike Avant, their funds take at least a week to become available. 


## Recommendations

* If I was advising Avant I would suggest, they diversify and get into the car insurance business. Competitor Sofi has teamed up with Root Insurance Co to provide insurance based on driver behavior. They use a cell phone app to track driving behavior over a period and determine if an individual is a safe driver or not. According to their website, those who qualify as safe drivers can save up to 52% on car insurance rates. Avant already employs advanced machine learning algorithms and big data to determine an individual's risk of default. Similar to Root, which looks beyond DMV records on their decision making, personal loan decisions depend on the person's behavior rather than **FICO** score alone.  The data that they collect can be used to determine a person's driving tendencies. 

* This service would benefit Avant by attracting drivers that have to wait up to three years for a single traffic violation to clear their DMV record and reduce insurance cost. This idea fits their vision of catering to middle income individuals with subprime credit scores.

* In order to get into the insurance business, Avant needs to expand the technologies it already possesses and provide usage-based insurance. It can use the cell phone application that are already available to collect data on driver behavior.
